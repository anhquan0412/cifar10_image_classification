# Cifar-10 Image Classification
Built a convolutional neural network with Tensorflow (no Keras) to classify images from CIFAR 10 dataset

The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples

This project is built so I can get used to Tensorflow API. CNN model is similar to LeNet 5 architecture and is created from scratch without the use of Tensorflow Layers packages or Keras

Test accuracy on test set is 71.23%
